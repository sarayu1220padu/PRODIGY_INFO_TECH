## 🔍 Introduction

During my internship at **Prodigy InfoTech**, I completed a variety of tasks designed to simulate real-world data science scenarios. These tasks gave me hands-on experience with data cleaning, visualization, machine learning models, and exploratory data analysis (EDA). This repository is organized to showcase my technical growth and project contributions throughout the internship.
